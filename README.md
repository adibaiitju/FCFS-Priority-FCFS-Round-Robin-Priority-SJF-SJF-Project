**First Come First Serve (FCFS): FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order they arrive. It's simple to implement but may lead to long waiting times for processes arriving later.**

**Round Robin (RR): RR is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is given a small unit of time to execute, and then moves to the back of the queue. It ensures fairness but may lead to high context switching overhead.**

**Shortest Job First (SJF): SJF is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where the process with the shortest execution time is selected next for execution. It minimizes average waiting time but requires accurate estimation of process durations.**

**Priority Scheduling: Priority scheduling is a scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a priority, and the process with the highest priority is executed first. It can suffer from starvation if lower-priority processes are continually overshadowed by higher-priority ones.**
